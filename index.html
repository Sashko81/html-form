        <p>Learning pathwaySection
            Ideally, you should start your learning journey by learning HTML. Start by reading Introduction to  HTML. You
            may then move on to learning about more advanced topics such as:

            CSS, and how to use it to style HTML (for example alter your text size and fonts used, add borders and drop
            shadows, layout your page with multiple columns, add animations and other visual effects.)
            JavaScript, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages (for example find your location and
            plot it on a map, make UI elements appear/disappear when you toggle a button, save users' data locally on
            their computers, and much much more.)
            Before starting this topic, you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the
            web passively (i.e. just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set
            up as detailed in Installing basic software, and understand how to create and manage files, as detailed in
            Dealing with files â€” both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.

            It is recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before attempting this topic, however,
            it isn't absolutely necessary; much of what is covered in the HTML basics article is also covered in our
            Introduction to HTML module, albeit in a lot more detail.
